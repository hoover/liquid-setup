# Liquid Investigations: Software Stack Setup
This repository contains [ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/) scripts
that set up the software stack for [liquid investigations][]. It's designed to
work in two scenarios: installation on a server or VPS, and preparing an OS
image for a cloud server or ARM64 microboard.

### Build an OS image
You can build a full system image, based on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, that includes the
liquid software bundle. This is done using [buildbot][].

[buildbot]: https://github.com/liquidinvestigations/buildbot

First, set up buildbot and make sure you can log into an instance. It should be
an arm64 instance running on arm64 hardware if you want to target a microboard,
or an x86_64 image running on x86_64 hardware if you want a server/cloud image.

Next, clone this repository inside the `shared` folder, and run the build
script in a buildbot instance (use `build-odroid_c2-image.sh for an odroid
arm64 image instead of an x86_64 image):

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/liquidinvestigations/setup ./shared/setup
$ echo 'liquid_domain: liquid.example.com' > ./shared/setup/ansible/vars/config.yml
$ ./buildbot run shared/setup/bin/build_image cloud
```

If all goes well, the image should be saved in the `shared/output` folder. You
can add the `--debug` flag to introspect any failures.

#### Convert the image
The build scripts produce "raw" images. You can convert them to VMware or
VirtualBox format. Append `-p` to get progress report.

```sh
qemu-img convert liquid-20170627-x86_64.img -O vmdk liquid-20170627-x86_64.vmdk
qemu-img convert liquid-20170627-x86_64.img -O vmi liquid-20170627-x86_64.vmi
```



### Set up on existing server
These instructions assume Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. They work on Debian systems with
some adaptations, YMMV.

```shell
$ add-apt-repository ppa:ansible/ansible -y # for Ansible 2.2 or newer
$ apt-get update
$ apt install ansible -y
$ cd /opt
$ git clone https://github.com/liquidinvestigations/setup
$ cd setup/ansible
$ echo 'liquid_domain: liquid.example.com' > ./vars/config.yml
$ ansible-playbook server.yml
```


## First boot
On first (re)boot, the bundle will configure databases, and import the
[testdata](https://github.com/hoover/testdata) collection into Hoover. This
will take a few minutes. You can follow the progress in the log file:

```
tail -f /var/log/rc.local.log
```

When the initialization scripts compete successfully, they will create the file
`/opt/common/first_boot_done`, so they don't run on the next boot.

### hotspot
On ARM system images, after the first-boot scripts complete, the system will
attempt to create a wireless hotspot, if it detecs any AP-capable wireless
interfaces. The SSID is `liquid`, password `chocolate`.

### Hoover and Hypothesis
Hoover and Hypothesis are started after first boot setup and automatically
started on subsequent boots.

They are accessible at subdomains of `liquid_domain` which was set above:
http://hoover.liquid.example.com and http://hypothesis.liquid.example.com
When running from a VM you may need to set up the VM network configuration
and put those hosts in your hosts file.

The services can be managed via `supervisorctl`.

## Development notes

The `devel` role sets up the following:

- user: `liquid`, password: `liquid`
- sudo access
- sshd on port 22 that accepts password authentication

The `devel` role can be enabled by putting `devel: true` into `vars/config.yml`.

### Docker
Some applications are installed as Docker containers. This is done to simplify
image creation and to separate the concern of app management from the concern
of system management.

Since the Liquid project targets X86_64 and ARM 32/64 architectures, we need
Docker images for all. Docker hub is a great place to get X86_64 images, but
the ARM image ecosystem is young, so we have to build our own images there.
Therefore, we maintain a Docker organization,
[liquidinvestigations](https://hub.docker.com/r/liquidinvestigations/), where
we publish x86_64 and arm32v6 images. We use the arm32v6 images on 64-bit ARM
platforms too, for simplicity.

In order to run Docker images on our target systems, we need dockerd and
docker-compose, and docker images for each app. The docker
[docker](ansible/roles/docker) role installs the required system packages. For
Docker images, in the "Set up on existing server" mode, they just get installed
normally. But for the "Build an OS image" scenaro, Docker can't run in a
chroot, so we pull the app images on the host system (by running the
[`image_host_docker.yml`](ansible/image_host_docker.yml) playbook), and copy
them over to the target chroot volume.
